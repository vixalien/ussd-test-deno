# USSD Test Deno

This is a simple app that tests your USSD endpoints. Built with Deno.

## Usage

### Hosted version

There is a hosted version of this app at
[ussd-test-deno.deno.dev](https://ussd-test-deno.deno.dev) but you will probably
want to run it locally because of CORS issues.

### Running locally

1. Install [Deno](https://deno.land/getting_started/installation)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `deno task start` to start the server
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` and start testing your USSDs
